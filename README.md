# Hate Speech Classification Project

This project aims to classify hate speech using various machine learning techniques. The tasks are divided into three parts:

### Task 1: Implement Logistic Regression
In this task, we implemented a Logistic Regression model from scratch without using any pre-existing machine learning libraries. The goal was to understand the inner workings of Logistic Regression by manually coding the model, loss function, and training process.

### Task 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset from 5000 features to a more manageable number. We tested the impact of different numbers of PCA components on model performance using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and reported the results on the test set.

### Task 3: Experiment with Other Machine Learning Models
In this task, we explored a variety of machine learning models beyond Logistic Regression to improve our classification performance. We experimented with different algorithms and hyperparameters, optimizing them for the best results. The goal was to achieve the highest score possible on the Kaggle leaderboard, with bonus marks awarded for top performance.
